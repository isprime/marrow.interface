h3(#goals). %1.1.% Why Avoid Duck Typing?




h2(#installation). %2.% Installation

Installing @marrow.interface@ is easy, just execute the following in a terminal: [2]

<pre><code>pip install marrow.interface</code></pre>

If you add @marrow.interface@ to the @install_requires@ argument of the call to @setup()@ in your application's @setup.py@ file, @marrow.interface@ will be automatically installed and made available when your own application is installed.  We recommend using "less than" version numbers to ensure there are no unintentional side-effects when updating.  Use @"marrow.interface<1.1"@ to get all bugfixes for the current release, and @"marrow.interface<2.0"@ to get bugfixes and feature updates, but ensure that large breaking changes are not installed.


h3(#install-dev). %2.1.% Development Version

Development takes place on "GitHub":github in the "marrow.mailer":github-project project.  Issue tracking, documentation, and downloads are provided there.

Installing the current development version requires "Git":git, a distributed source code management system.  If you have Git, you can run the following to download and _link_ the development version into your Python runtime:

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/marrow/marrow.interface.git
(cd marrow.interface; python setup.py develop)</code></pre>

You can upgrade to the latest version at any time:

<pre><code>(cd marrow.interface; git pull; python setup.py develop)</code></pre>

If you would like to make changes and contribute them back to the project, fork the GitHub project, make your changes, and submit a pull request.  This process is beyond the scope of this documentation; for more information, see "GitHub's documentation":github-help.

fn1. In order to run the full test suite you need to install "pymta":http://www.schwarz.eu/opensource/projects/pymta/ and its dependencies.

fn2. If "Pip":http://www.pip-installer.org/ is not available for you, you can use @easy_install@ instead. We have much love for Pip and "Distribute":http://packages.python.org/distribute/, though.
